# rust-kad

A generic / futures based implementation of the Kademlia DHT, heavily inspired by [dtantsur/rust-dht](https://github.com/dtantsur/rust-dht) with the goal of providing a simple to use, well-tested, low-dependency, futures-based API for using DHTs with arbitrary communication mechanisms and encodings

## Status
